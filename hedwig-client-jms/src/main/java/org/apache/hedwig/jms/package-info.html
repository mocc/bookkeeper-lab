<h3>Introduction</h3>

Contains the basic (hedwig agnostic) aspects of the provider implementation <br/>
This package enforces (to a large part) the constraints expected by JMS api and maintains state and
manages the lifecycle of rest of the provider system. <br/>
<p/>
It depends only on message package.<br/>
It is decoupled from actual nitty-gritties of the hedwig specific aspects via a Facade - which
encapsulates all functionalities required off hedwig. <br/>
It is envisioned that we will have additional implementations for the facade as time goes by :
<ul>
  <li>Test mockup facade to test provider aspects decoupled from hedwig</li>
  <li>Facade's to experiment with add and/or modify functionality exposed to provider (support for
    Queue for example without modifying existing code).</li>
  <li>Facade's to experiment with add and/or modify functionality to hedwig itself.</li>
  <li>This space for rent :-)</li>
</ul>


<h3>Missing functionality</h3>

Various aspects of JMS are currently unsupported - the detailed list is long, but the main caveats
with the provider currently are :
<ul>

  <li>No support for Queues : Hedwig currently does not have a notion of JMS queue's for us to leverage.</li>

  <li>No support for noLocal : Hedwig DOES NOT conform to JMS model of
    connection -(n)-> session -(n)-> publisher/subscriber. Each session has a hedwig connection.<br/>
Currently I am simulating noLocal, but this IS fragile and works for the duration of connection -
    ONLY until the message id is still in a LRUCache. As mentioned before, this is a kludge, and not
    a good solution.<br/>
  </li>

  <li>Note that everything is durable in hedwig - so we do not support NON_PERSISTENT delivery mode.</li>

  <li>Calling unsubscribe on a durable subscription will fail if it was NOT created in the current session. <br/>
    In hedwig, to unsubscribe, we need the subscription id and the topic ... <br/>
    To simulate unsubscribe(), we store the subscriberId to topicName mapping when a create* api is
    invoked. <br/>
    Hence, if create* was NOT called, then we have no way to infer which topic the subscription-id
    refers to from hedwig, and so cant unsubscribe. <br/>
    The workaround is - simply create a durable subsriber just as a workaround of this limitation -
    the topicName will be known to the user/client anyway.</li>

  <li>Explicit session recovery is not supported.<br/>
Reconnection of hedwig session (either explicitly or implicitly by underlying client implementation) will
automatically trigger redelivery of un-acknowledged messages.
  </li>

  <li>Because of the above, setting the JMSRedelivered flag is almost impossible in a consistent way.<br/>
Currently, we simulate it for redelivery due to provider side events : rollback of txn, exception
    in message listener (primarily). <br/>
At best we can simulate it with a kludge - at risk of potentially running out of resources ... this
    is being investigated : but unlikely to have a clean fix. <br/>
  </li>

  <li>Hedwig only supports marking all messages until seq-id as received : while JMS indicates abilit
    y to acknowledge individual messages.<br/>
This distinction is currently unsupported. Investigating if we can do something about it.
  </li>

  <li>JMS spec requires
    "A connection's delivery of incoming messages can be temporarily stopped <br/>
using its stop() method. It can be restarted using its start() method. When the <br/>
connection is stopped, delivery to all the connectionâ€™s MessageConsumers is <br/>
inhibited: synchronous receives block, and messages are not delivered to <br/>
MessageListeners."<br/>
  We honour this for undelivered messages from server - but if stop is called while there are
    pending messages yet to be delivered to a listner (or buffered in subscriber for receive),
    then they will be delivered irrespective of stop().</li>

</ul>
Hopefully I am not missing any of the big points ...
